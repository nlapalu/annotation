# INGENANNOT: INspection of GENe ANNOTation

INGENANNOT is a set of utilities to inspect and generate 
statistics of one or several set of gene annotation. It allows
structure comparison and can help you to prioritize your 
effort in manual gene annotation. INGENNANNOT uses the
Sequence Ontology gene-splicing classification [1]() that aims
to classify alternative transcripts in seven defined 
categories.
